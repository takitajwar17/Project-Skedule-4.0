Skedule aims to streamline the process of obtaining essential information, eliminating the need to search through multiple platforms and saving valuable time for students.

## Features

### Routine

The Routine feature in Skedule allows students to view their daily schedules in an organized manner. It provides information such as subject/course name, time, room number, and teacher's name for each class. By accessing the Routine section, students can quickly and easily refer to their daily schedule.

### Announcements

The Announcements feature enables authorized users, such as Class Representatives (CRs) or Captains, to post important updates or announcements. Students can access this section to stay informed about any new information. Regular students can only view the updates and cannot post new announcements themselves.

### Events/Advertisements

The Events/Advertisements feature displays news about campus events, curriculum activities, and promotions. All students can post information related to events or advertisements in this section. However, CRs or Captains have the authority to approve or decline posts made by other students, ensuring the content remains relevant and appropriate.

### Quiz/Exams

The Quiz/Exams feature provides students with a comprehensive list of upcoming exams and quizzes. The list is sorted by date and includes relevant details such as the exam time, room number, and syllabus. Students can refer to this section to stay updated on their upcoming assessments.

### Assignments

The Assignments feature organizes all homework and assignments according to their due dates. Students can easily access this section to keep track of their pending assignments. The assignments are sorted by date, making it convenient for students to prioritize their work.

### Self-Assessment

The Self-Assessment feature allows students to track their own performance in class. Students can input their quiz marks, mid-term and final exam scores, as well as attendance records on a course-by-course basis. This section helps students monitor their progress and evaluate their academic performance.

### Discussion

The Discussion feature provides a platform for students to ask questions, seek clarification, or engage in discussions on specific topics. Students can communicate with their peers and exchange knowledge, fostering a collaborative learning environment.

### In-built Clock

Skedule includes an in-built clock on the home page/dashboard. It displays the current time and, if there is a scheduled class at that particular time, it also shows the class name and room number. This feature serves as a convenient reminder for students, ensuring they don't miss any classes.

## Additional Micro Features

Skedule also offers several additional micro features designed to simplify students' lives further. These features, although not explicitly mentioned in the description, enhance the overall user experience and provide added convenience and efficiency.

## Using Skedule

As a first-time user, one need to register using one's academic credentials provided by institution. After successful login, one can navigate through various modules using the side navigation panel. Each module has its functionality and actions that can be performed.

**Note:** Some features such as 'Announcements' and 'Events/Advertisements' require special permissions, available only to CRs or Captains.
